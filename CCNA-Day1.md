1. Networks - What is a network?
  
	- a network is a connection of telacommunication devics( clients and servers ) (nodes) that are connected and can share resources
 
2. Servers & Clients

   - what is a client?  
	- a client can be a laptop or a pc it could be a mac or iphone or tablet, but a client is a device that accesses a servi	  ce made available by a server
    
    - What is a server?
	- a server is a device that can provide services to a client 
	- a server CAN be a client and a server at the same time
	- client sends a request and the server satisfies the request and send its back to the client

    - clients and servers are most usually connected through the internet
    - servers and clients send data as a stream over the internet/network
    -  

3. Switches

  - What is a switch?
	- switches are devices within a network that connect devices together
	- they forward traffic within a LAN
	- could be a printer/pc/tablet/server
	- clients and servers may both be connected to switches
	- switches DO NOT connect to the internet they onyl connect devices
	- switches have usually 24 or more ports for end hosts to connect to
	- end hosts in the same area connected by switches
	- to connect to internet you need a router
4. Routers
  
  - What is a router?
	- switches connect end devices within a LAN, switches then go to routers which are what connect LANs to the internet
	- routers have fewer network switches than switches
	- are used to provide connectivity between LANs
	- used to send data through the internet
	
5. Firewalls
 
  - What is a firewall? 
	- firewalls are specialty network sec devices that control network traffic entering and exiting your network
	- can be placed in or out of network
	- they protect end hosts inside networks
	- firewalls must be configured
	- basically a checkpoint that allows or denies different types of connections to devices in a network
	- there are 'next gen firewalls' 
	- firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on rules configed 
	- can be inside or outside of network
	- next gen firewalls are more modern and have better filtering capabilities
  
  - Network Firewalls
	- theres network firewalls which are hardware devices and ...
	- there are host based firewalls which are software apps that do firewall job
	- best practice would be to utilize both of these

  - There are other kinds of network devices besides these.
  - can find flashcards using ANKI software
