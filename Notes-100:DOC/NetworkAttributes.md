1. MAC Address

Every 802.x network card (wireless, ethernet, token ring) has a unique 48 bit identifier known as a MAC address. This address is burned into the EEPROM on the card, and oftentimes is used by networking equipment to track users as they come and go, frequently associating MAC address to hotel or dorm room #, credit card number, login info, etc. This means hopping on a network that has authenticated your hardware before and expecting to be anonymous this time around is pure idiocy.
