# tor -
 
uses 3 intermediary nodes to bounce your traffic around before its original intended destination

all trustless of eachother

multiple different kinds of encryption to increase anonymity 

this is what makes tor better than just proxy k1, k2, k3 encryptiion

hence 'onion' because of the layers

this does slow your traffic down obviously
