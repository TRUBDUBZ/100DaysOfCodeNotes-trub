# Trub's 100DaysOfCodeNotes 
  
 üìì *My notes and resources git repositorie for the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge*
  
 üìñ The 100 days challenge was started back in 2016 by [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) member, Alexander Kallaway. You can read more about the history of the challenge here [The100DaysofCodeChallenge and it's History](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/)
  
 üíª I have been sharing my daily progress along with a short summary of what I learned each day of the challenge on my Twitter profile using the challenge hashtag. You can find my progress here [Twitter](www.twitter.com/marcusdiedrich1). At some point I'm hoping to program a twitter bot to automate that.

 üèÜ The goal of this repo is to keep track of any useful useful/helpful/interesting information and have a place to store and reference for the future.
