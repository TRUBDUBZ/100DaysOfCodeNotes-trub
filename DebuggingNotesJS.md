Debugging
  - in javascript debugging is done often times using the console.log()
  - this will print to the console and show you potential errors or at least give hints as to what needs fixed
  - a good thing to do when running into bugs/errors in code is check for misspelling/quotation issues/closing the parenthesis/brackets corectly
  - check to make sure any infinite loops have an exit
